- Answers should be between two to five minutes

#### Use the S.T.A.R. method

Many job coaches will recommend using the S.T.A.R. method for preparing answers to behavioral questions:

- _Situation_ or _Task_ – describe briefly what the scenario was, or the task you were asked to accomplish.
- _Action_ – what did you do, what did you accomplish, what did you change?
- _Result_ – what was the outcome, how did it make things better/worse?

#### Practice your answers

Write out your answers to these questions, and the practice them out loud. Get an app that can record your voice and replay them to yourself. Practice the answers, refine them, and you’ll rely less and less on your notes so that you can relay the information from memory. Have a friend ask you the questions and listen to your recordings for how well you project confidence in your answers.

It’s also important to keep distractions to a minimum in your answer. For example, starting every answer with “filler” words such as “So, yeah, okay, um…” Another distraction in the interview is going off on tangents. Be sure you listen to the entire question, and that your answer contains information which is relevant to each portion of the question.
