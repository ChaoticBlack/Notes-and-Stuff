Q) Tell me about some of your projects at a technical level. How do you learn new skills or stay current on upcoming trends in the industry. Tell me about common data structures. What kind of development do you want to be doing in 3 years? 5 years?

Q) Tell me which programming languages you know, and what you like about them.
A) I primarily code in C++ but I am well versed with Python, C and Javascript to some extent. I love how C++ gives me complete control over every aspect of the code. This is particularly useful when I am trying to build something from the ground up. I use python when I want ease. Coding in C++ is like piloting an aircraft whereas coding in python is like guiding an aircraft from the air control center. I love using python and Javascript for my generative art projects!
