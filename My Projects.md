## A Multi-Input, Multi-Task, Transformer-Based Architecture for Empathy and Distress  Prediction.
- Developed a complex Transformer-Based Architecture to predict different types of psychological empathy based primarily on textual data aided by numerical and categorical data types.
- Achieved high distress correlation (0.574), and for the empathy correlation (0.517).
- This system is useful for understanding the pyschological reaction of people to different real world events.
- Work published at the 11th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis (WASSA 2021), co-located with EACL 2021.

## A Dataset and Framework for Multilingual and Code-Mixed VQA.
- Developed a comprehensive Visual Question Answering dataset for Marathi and Marathi+English Code-Mix language.
- This dataset consists of 80k images and 250k diverse questions and answers.
- Implemented a generalized pipeline for converting english datasets to almost any Indic Language. This ise helpful for generating datasets for low resource languages.
