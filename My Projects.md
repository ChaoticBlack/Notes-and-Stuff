## A Multi-Input, Multi-Task, Transformer-Based Architecture for Empathy and Distress  Prediction.
- Developed a complex Transformer-Based Architecture to predict different types of psychological empathy based primarily on textual data aided by numerical and categorical data types.
- Achieved high distress correlation (0.574), and for the empathy correlation (0.517).
- This system is useful for understanding the psychological reaction of people to different real world events.
- Work published at the 11th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis (WASSA 2021), co-located with EACL 2021.

## A Dataset and Framework for Multilingual and Code-Mixed VQA.
- Developed a comprehensive Visual Question Answering dataset for Marathi and Marathi+English Code-Mix language.
- This dataset consists of 80k images and 250k diverse questions and answers.
- Implemented a generalized pipeline for converting english datasets to almost any Indic Language. This is helpful for generating datasets for low resource languages.
Domain: Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision.

## "PotterCode" Programming Language.
- Invented a new Turing complete Programming Language called PotterCode from scratch aimed at children to learn programming and get into the "programming mindset"
- Developed brand new syntax based on the Harry Potter Universe to ease the process of learning programming for kids.
- Employed concepts of Language Design, Theory of Computation to build an online transpiler using Peg.js for the parser and Node.js for the backend.
- Winning Project of the DelhiHacks National Level Hackathon 2020.
Domain: Compiler Design, Web Development.

## Pothole Reporting App for Smart Cities.
- Developed an android application that verifies and reports potholes along with their location to the authorities.
- Deployed an image classification model to check if user uploaded images are legitimate or not.
- Used Google Maps API to highlight pothole locations and to enable two way communication between the citizens and authorities. Also designed a secure login portal for authorities using modern network security concepts.
- The application was programmed in Android Studios in Java while the model was written in python. Firebase Database was used to store the images, locations and other details.

## Donation Portal for Disaster Management.
- Programmed a web based decentralized, secure, transparent, traceable and infinitely scalable donation portal that can be used in times of a natural disaster.
- Employed the Ethereum Blockchain to implement the smart contracts that will enable fair use of donations and mitigate mismanagement of funds. Also used IBM Watson Chatbot Assistant for ease of use of the portal.
- Winning Project at IBM Cummins Hackathon 2020.
Domains: Blockchain, Web Development.

## Image Captioning System.
- In this open source project, I helped design and train a CNN-RNN (Convolutional Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network) model for automatically generating image captions. 
- The network is trained on the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext [(MS COCO)](http://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset, which contains around 80 thousand images and corresposnding captions.
- I worked on it as part of the Student Code-In Global Program for Open Source Contributions.
Domain: Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing.

## Chip 8 emulator.
- CHIP-8 interpreter, developed in the late 1970s only had sixteen 8 bit registers and a 4kB memory and 35 different instructions. It used to support many iconic games like Snake, space invaders and Pong.
- I emulated the Chip 8 interpreter in C++, programming its hardware as software and writing its ISA as functions. My Chip 8 emulator can run any program (.ch8) that was originally written for the Chip 8 interpreter.
Domains: Hardware Emulation, Kernel level programming, Object Oriented Programming.

## Round Trip Planner
- Using AWS Cloud and Google Map services, we designed and developed a round trip planner, which advises you on the optimal route to plan a round trip of "N" real world locations. It takes into consideration the live traffic data and your vehicle details to generate the optimal path.
- Our system solves the Travelling Salesman Problem using Ant Colony Optimization (A genetic algorithm) to plan the trip. 
- This feature that even Google Maps doesn't provide, can be of immense use for Delivery agents starting from a warehouse who need to visit multiple locations and return back to the warehouse.
Domain: Algorithms, Cloud, Web Development.

## Lay Summarization of Biomedical Articles.
- Given a Biomedical article's abstract and main text as input, we have trained deep learning models to summarize it in layman's terms.
- We trained various different models including BERT, RoBERTa and Pegasus to obtain results of varying degree of readability.
- The models are trained on PLOS and Elife Datasets which include around 24k medical articles.
Domains: Natural Language Processing.
