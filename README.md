# Notes-and-Stuff

This repo contains the coding notes I made during my M.E at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus.

## Steps to use:
1) Download this repo and unzip the folders.
2) To view the files as intended, download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download).
3) Run obsidian and open the folder as a vault. (Obsidian will guide you through it)
4) Install the relevant plugins. You will have to install Audio Player plugin if you want to utilize the audio files, otherwise no need.
5) That's basically it.

## Folder contents:
To access the list of solutions I have in this vault, open the "Solved Questions.md" file. Go through the list and click on the "Solution" backlink of the particular question that you want. This will open the file containing the solution. All the solution files are stored in the "Solutions" folder. 

Other files and folders are self explanatory I think.

## Building on top of the exisiting work:
If you want to use this vault to make your own notes, be my guest! You have have to go through some basic Obsidian tutorials, but the general idea is that you use the "Template.md" file to make notes for a new problem that you solved. Move this new file to the Solutions folder, open the "Solved Questions.md" file and add the problem title, tags etc to this file. Also backlink the newly created solution file here. That's it.

## General Suggestions:
1) Use the tags to search for questions of a specifc category while revising. Click the search icon on the top left to search.
2) Obsidian supports images, pdfs, audio files and so much more. Utilize this to your benefit to smoothen the process of note taking.
3) Check out the community plugins to see what works for you.
4) Obsidian has a slight learning curve, but if you invest in learning it, the long term rewards are substantial.
