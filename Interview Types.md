## [[Behavioral interviews]]
Behavioral questions attempt to gauge how you would behave in stressful or otherwise adverse conditions. There are a couple common types of behavioral questions:

-    **"Tell me about a time..."** These questions are based on the idea that the best predictor of future behavior is past performance. The goal is to get you to present real examples of how you have handled things like conflict and failure in the past so the company can have some insight into how you may behave in the future.
-    **Scenarios.** Rather than looking for past examples, scenario question present you with situations and you're asked how you would handle them. Interviewers are generally looking for problem solving and empathy skills when asking these questions.

> BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEW EXAMPLE QUESTION
> Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a team member and how you handled it?


## [[Values interviews]]

Not to be confused with behavioral interviews, values interviews attempt to gauge how you align with a company's value system. For example, Google has its [Ten things we know to be true](https://about.google/philosophy/), which is a set of philosophies against which candidates might be assessed.

Some companies explicitly test against values while others unconsciously make this assessment. Regardless, it's very important to know a company's public values and be prepared to demonstrate how you align with them.

>VALUES INTERVIEW EXAMPLE QUESTION
> At our company, one of our core values is "team above individual." How have you exemplified this value?


## [[Leetcode Interviews]]

Leetcode-style interviews are probably the most famous, or should I say infamous, type of interview. Leetcode is a website with algorithm and data structure programming problems. In Leetcode-style interviews, you solve algorithm and data structure challenges in front of one or more interviewers. These challenges are performed on a white board or a computer depending on the company's preference and whether the interview is being conducted in-person or remotely.

These challenges aim to test your problem solving, collaboration, and technical skill. Often, interviewers will ask for your understanding of the time and space complexity required to run the algorithm.

These types of interviews were popularized by big tech companies but are used throughout the industry. For those of us who are really uncomfortable with this type of interview, there are plenty of companies that do not use Leetcode-style interviews.


## [[Practical Coding]] Interviews

Practical coding interviews involve collaborative coding to solve a job-related problem. This is one of my favorite interview types because, unlike Leetcode-style interviews, it focuses on the kind of work you might do on a day-to-day basis. For example, if you're a front-end engineer, your coding challenge might be to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to a specification. In these interviews, it's extremely important to fully understand the requirements and the level of interaction/collaboration the interviewer expects.

## Technical knowledge/trivia interviews

Technical trivia interviews generally don't involve writing code, but rather ask you technical questions to determine how well you know a subject area. These types of interviews get a bad rap, but their effectiveness really depends a lot on what types of questions are asked. For example, asking about some uncommon/obscure language feature that can be googled quickly is pointless and a bad way to assess someone's domain knowledge. On the other hand, asking someone about a foundational aspect of a domain works may be useful. Technical knowledge questions are fairly common in all interviews.


## What interviews should I prep?

That's a lot of interview types! The interviews you should prep for depend a lot on the types of companies to which you're applying. Realistically, the only type of interview you don't need to prep is the leetcode-style interview if you know the companies at which you're interviewing don't do leetcode interviews.

If you want to know what types of questions certain companies ask, I recommend the following:

-    Look at the company's interview section on Glassdoor.
-    If you're preparing for an interview at a specific company, ask your recruiter. In pretty   much every case, my recruiters have told me the exact types of interviews I'll be undergoing.
